### Anomaly Detector - Project in Advanced Programming course

In this project we have created a flight detector designed for flight analysis.
Each flight has a number of properties. We had a Correlation threshold that if the correlation between two properties is above it then the properties are considered correlative.
When a certain value is above the correlation threshold between two correlative properties the detector reports an anomaly.
